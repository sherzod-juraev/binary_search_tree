# Tree Data Structures Package

This package contains fundamental tree data structures implemented from scratch, including:

- **Binary Tree** – A tree structure where each node has at most two children.  
  [More info →](./binary_tree/README.md#binarytree-package)

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)** – A binary tree with the property that the left child is smaller than the parent, and the right child is greater.  
  [More info →](./binary_search_tree/README.md#binary-search-tree-package)

- **AVL Tree** – A self-balancing binary search tree that maintains O(log n) height by performing rotations after insertions and deletions.  
  [More info →](./avl_tree/README.md#avl-tree)

Each sub-package contains a detailed explanation, implementation, and example usage of its respective tree structure.
